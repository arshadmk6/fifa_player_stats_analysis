# fifa_player_stats_analysis
## Abstract
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of player stats in FIFA 22 using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to help managers find the best team and FIFA game players to get optimal results. By analyzing different plots and graphs, the project predicts the overall scores by training the features of the players as input. Additionally, an online manager is developed to make a predictive analysis and find the best team for selected countries. This will help determine the best formation and the eleven best players for each position.

## Project Summary
The project uses Jupyter Notebook as the primary tool for analysis and utilizes some machine learning techniques such as regression models and prediction techniques. To gain knowledge on these techniques, the author studied tutorials from Udemy and consulted resources from Kaggle and towardsdatascience.com. The data was collected by web scraping sofifa.com using the Beautiful Soup library and saved as a CSV file. The Jupyter Notebook was used for data processing, data extraction, and analysis.

## Data Processing & Analytical Methods
The data was prepared for analysis by web scraping sofifa.com and saved as a CSV file. The Jupyter Notebook was used to extract the data and perform the analysis. The author faced challenges while scraping the data as they had to scrape each player's data separately. However, as the data was presented in a table, it was easy to extract the required information. The Jupyter Notebook was chosen for analysis as it provides a flexible environment for scientific computation and computational data analytics.
